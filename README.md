# RandomBenchmarks
Random benchmark for MUSes extraction.

## Interpretation of filenames
All filenames are in the format of **{label}\_{marco}\_{input}\_{lnum}\_{cnum}**. And all files are in the standard DIMACS cnf format.

- The **label** is useless.
- The **"marco"** and **"input"** are fixed.
- The **lnum** is the number of different literals of this instance.
- The **cnum** is the number of clauses of this instance.
